# MicroPackets

Real Time High Level Synthesis in Dynamically Reconfigurable VLSI Processors. For a background information please refer to the earlier paper:

In general, `main.py` is where application starts. One may run `python3 main.py > out.txt` command to write terminal results to the txt file. Feel free, also, to change the `inputs.txt` to check for the different sets of equations. 

Respective algorithms parts are put in dfg_generator.py, stage1.py, stage2.py, stage3.py. Comments and print statements should help to understand implementation :)
