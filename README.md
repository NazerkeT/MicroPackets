# MicroPackets

Real Time High Level Synthesis in Dynamically Reconfigurable VLSI Processors. More descriptions, results on research project will arrive later.

For now feel free to run and check main.py. One may run "python3 main.py > out.txt" command to write terminal results to txt file. Feel free, also, to change inputs.txt to check for different sets of equations. 

Respective algorithms parts are put in dfg_generator.py, stage1.py, stage2.py, stage3.py. Comments and print statements should help to understand implementation.
